## Overview

This project contains a complete Lox interpreter written in Java. The interpreter includes a scanner, parser, resolver, and interpreter for executing Lox programs.

## Features

- Lexical analysis and tokenization using a scanner.
- Parsing the Lox grammar and constructing an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- Resolving variable scopes and bindings.
- Interpreting and executing Lox programs.
- Error handling and reporting for syntax and runtime errors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run the jlox Java interpreter, you need to have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.

### Building the Interpreter

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Livingstone-Billy/java-jlox.git
cd jlox
```
##Issues
- Currently working on to add implementation for lambda or anonymous functions in the Lox interprater based on Crafting Interpreters book by Bob Nystrom
